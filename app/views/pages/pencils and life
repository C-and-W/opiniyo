pencils and life

- our worth inside us
- we emphasize so much on the outside
- we fake our smiles to project we're okay even if in reality our world is already broken/falling apart
  - do not think that ur value is simply how u look, u have a value deeper than that and that is what it means to be a gift
- the only way to live our life is to simplify it
- tension bet personal fulfillment vs financial                                                                                                                                                                   reward
- we have to be sharpened, pressured
  - sharpening is a painful process, entails keeping/losing some parts
  - a happy life is remembering just enough, forgetting just enough
- tendency of man to acquire but we cannot acquire all
- learning is a painful process
  - lahat naman ng bago masakit
- pain - do use it as stumblingblock or steppingstone?
- when going thu something, do not make any decisions - they are always wrong -take aimless walks, wander
  - not all who wander are lost
-the mark u leave behind depends on how well u were sharpened
- we live our lives leaving marks - responsibility (others call it freedom)
- dont be afraid to commit mistakes, but always commit new mistakes (pencil has erase)
  - first mistake is living, replicated one is stupidity
- do not stay in ur brokenness - a wund that is constantly scratched becomes infected
- i am broken, shattered, lost but who is not
- mistakes can be erased but the trace of our fallibilty remains but that''s ok
  - our imperfections make us distinct
  - imperfect but beautiful nevertheless
  - our woundedness makes us who we are
- it is the yes that we make that changes our waking and walking, that determine our lives

-what if the pencil, ur life, u, are held by an inexperienced child vss artist
- choose who to commit ur life to, it will determine who u're going to be
- let the artist hold ur life
  - artists spend a long time drawing bec the things that last are never instant

- let christ hold ur life, he alone can turn our lives into a wonderful work of art

- ur worth is inside u -> u will be sharpened- -> u can erase ur mistakes -> what becomes of u depends on who holds u

- pray unceasingly. love immeasurably. live fully
  - we become who we contemplate
  - the measure of love is to love  without measure
  - everything u do out of love can never be wrong
    - ibuhos mo lang ung pag-ibig
  - at the end of ur life u will be judged by love again. do not be afraid to love
  - the glory of god is the human person fully and truly alive
    - if they are gifts from god, they will lead u back to god
